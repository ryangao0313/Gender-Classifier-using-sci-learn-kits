# Gender Prediction from Physical Characteristics

This Python script predicts the gender (male or female) based on physical characteristics, such as height, weight, and shoe size. It uses various machine learning classifiers to make predictions and evaluates their accuracy.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

3. Open the script (`gender_prediction.py`) and customize the dataset `X` and labels `Y` to match your dataset. The dataset should be a list of physical characteristics (height, weight, shoe size) and their corresponding labels (male or female).

```python
# Data set [height, weight, shoe_size]
X = [[181, 80, 44], [177, 70, 43], ...]
Y = ['male', 'male', 'female', ...]
```

4. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

```bash
python gender_prediction.py
```

5. The script will display the predictions made by different classifiers (Decision Tree, Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Process, and Neural Network) for a sample input and also output the accuracy scores for each classifier.

## Customizing the Dataset

You can customize the dataset `X` and labels `Y` to train the classifiers on your own dataset. Ensure that the dataset structure (features and labels) matches your data.
